**SQL Tutorial 1: Overview on Database, DBMS/RDBMS, SQL |Database Components | SQL for Testers**

**1. What is DBMS & RDBMS?**
DBMS (Database Management System):
A software that allows storing, retrieving, and managing data in a structured format using tables. It organizes data and handles operations like insert, update, and delete.
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
An advanced form of DBMS that supports relationships between tables. It uses keys (primary and foreign) to link data, enabling more efficient data organization and retrieval.
Examples: Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL Server, DB2.

**2. What is a Database?**
A database is a structured collection of data stored electronically.
It allows easy access, management, and updating of data.
Databases are used in almost all software applications to store information about users, transactions, products, etc.

**3. What is SQL?**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with databases.
It’s used for:
Inserting new data
Retrieving existing data
Updating records
Deleting data
SQL is the bridge between the user (or application) and the data stored in a database.

**4. Database Components – Client & Server**
Server:
The database server is where the actual database resides. It processes SQL queries and stores the data. Usually hosted on secure remote systems (e.g., Unix/Linux).
Client:
The client is the software/tool used to connect to the server and send SQL commands. It can be:
GUI-based (e.g., Aqua Data Studio, Toad)
CLI-based (Command Line Interface)
Clients allow developers and testers to write, execute, and manage SQL commands to interact with the database server.
